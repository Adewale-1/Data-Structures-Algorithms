# Heaps

A heap is a tree based data structure that satisfies the heap invariant: If A is a parent node of B then A is ordered with respect to B for all nodes A,B in the heap.

In the Max Heap, the root of the tree is greater than or equal to all subsequent leaf nodes, 8 greater than 7 and 6 and Recursively all other parent nodes are.

In the Min Heap, the root of the tree is lesser than or equal to all subsequent leaf nodes, 0 lesser than 2 and 3 and Recursively all other parent nodes are.

## For Example

  <img src="/Assets/2.png" width="600" height = "300"/>

No, we have a violation of the heap invariant
<img src="/Assets/3.png" width="600" height = "300" />

<img src="/Assets/4.png"width="600" height = "300" />
Yes! This is a tree and it satisfies the heap invariant.
